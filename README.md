2. Use the content generator in your code:

```javascript
const { createContent } = require('./src/contentGenerator');

// Prepare a content brief
const contentBrief = {
  niche: 'indoor hydroponics',
  topic: 'Best Hydroponic Systems for Beginners',
  primaryKeyword: 'beginner hydroponic systems',
  wordCount: 2000,
  sections: ['Introduction', 'What is Hydroponics', 'Top 5 Systems for Beginners', 'Setup Guide', 'Maintenance Tips', 'Conclusion'],
  targetAudience: 'Beginner gardeners interested in hydroponics',
  secondaryKeywords: ['easy hydroponics', 'hydroponic starter kit', 'indoor growing systems'],
  tone: 'informative and encouraging'
};

// Generate the content
async function generateArticle() {
  const result = await createContent(contentBrief);
  
  if (result.status === 'success') {
    console.log('Content generated successfully!');
    console.log(`Word count: ${result.metrics.wordCount}`);
